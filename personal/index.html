        <p>ee idk what i should use as a title so i shall just have it as the date for now.</p>
<p>i havent really been using my computer a whole lot in a while, i dont really have much to do nowadays on it anyways. </p>
<p>though, recently i have been falling down the rabbit hole of 90s styled stuff, i found an old handycam and ive been trying to make it work properly - it even records on a tape and all and its all very fascinating to me. i also started using this old camera i found which really makes me appreciate the beauty of stuff from the 1990s and 2000s. now almost everything is doable from a slim boring flashy phone.</p>
<p>ive also been experimenting w/ the chicago95 xfce theme - it really is a work of art like idk something ab things from that period of time just feels right, even though i wasnt even alive back then. </p>
<p>im planning to try to make this really old boxkinda computer we have packed up tmrw or sum lets see i shall make a post here accordingly idk.</p>
<p>anyways okay bye :)) </p>

      <h4><a href="#may summary."> # </a> may summary. (2023-05-28)</h4>
      <div class="post__summary">
        <p>the months not over yet but might as well sum up what i did this month.</p>
<p>i uh made two utility scripts - without just skidding off of other people.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/2200g/drives.sh">drives.sh</a> -- a command line utility that helps users mount new ext4 drives.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/2200g/notes.sh">notes.sh</a> -- a simple note making cli tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>idk why but i am somewhat proud of myself for making them anyways yes.</p>
<p>i also uh studied quite a bit, got put into a coaching institute like one week ago and so far its going pretty well - i do have a lot to catch up on tho.</p>
<p>i also had exams this week - was pretty decent and uh yeah my summer vacations about to start, 22 days of not going to school. {i dont get a vacation from coaching :')} schools fun tho so eh.</p>
<p>one thing w all that tho is that i am not able to study by myself at home like i used to, kind of a bummer cuz that was probably the only time i studied properly but ye ill fix something up okok</p>
<p>next month, i am hoping to uh get physically active more- idk my current bmi is 22.7 and thats kinda decent and also uh learn how to drive idk ok bye </p>

      <div class="post__summary">
        <p>okay so to concentrate on important things, you sometimes have to let go of other things, that may not seem as significant as the important thing.</p>
<p>its really important to manage your time properly and accordingly give specific amounts of time for one task.</p>
<p>quitting a game like minecraft is really hard, as you sometimes develop somewhat of a connection w the people you play with or even the game itself. even though it sometimes gets repetitive, it really is fun to play. </p>
<p>i have quit minecraft for a bit a couple of times and everytime i return to it, the feeling is exhilarating. i have fun doing the same old thing again and remembering certain events and that makes it all the more enjoyable to me.</p>
<p>but, doing the same thing over and over again gets really boring and you just play for the sake of it, not just cuz ure having fun. you just spend hours and hours grinding for stats that dont even matter much. </p>
<p>im not saying that the game sucks, or is dead, but that to truly enjoy yourself you have to sometimes take a step back, and just stop playing. instead, focus on other things, till you start craving for the game once again. only then it is possible to truly enjoy the beauty of a game like minecraft.</p>
<p>ok bai.</p>
