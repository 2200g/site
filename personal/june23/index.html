<p>june went by pretty fast and so has this third of july but yes anyways.</p>

<p>i had my summer vacation for like three weeks and yea i studied pretty much the entire time aha - its fun for me tho.</p>
<p>i made a couple of new friends irl and found out one of ems actually nice and ye</p>
<p>ive also been playing throwball a lot and not to toot my own horn but i am actually pretty insane at throwball :)))</p>
