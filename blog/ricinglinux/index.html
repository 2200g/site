<p>the first time i ever customised my linux set up was back during corona when we still had online classes.</p>
<p>i had watched this video titled: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uucr0xHoz1A">&quot;cerulean - make linux beautiful&quot;</a> posted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sudo_rice">#sudo</a>. </p>
<p>i had never really seen such artistic beauty before- i never really had seen any rices up until that point. </p>
<p>i followed his guide on how to get my setup to look like that, and did everything accordingly. this was during classes - and i couldnt attend any that day haha.</p>
<p>anyways its been like what 2 years since then, and i dont think ive ever went back to a &quot;desktop environment&quot; or uh a non-tiling window manager since then. (i do not know the proper terminology :3)</p>
<p>i've used multiple window managers - bspwm, i3wm, xmonad, awesomewm, qtile and now dwm. i've riced p much all of em following tutorials and stuff and yeah its been pretty fun. i dont really get why i like to switch wms sm but yea. </p>
<p>currently, i am an avid fan of <a href="https://youtube.com/@bugswriter_">bugswriter</a>, and i watch pretty much every video he uploads. he uploaded this video, titled: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqVuAUP2N0">&quot;linux ricing crash course.&quot;</a> and it went over pretty much every point you need to have a nicely riced set-up.</p>
<p>ill link a couple of stuff to supplement the things he went over in his video: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Sxhkd">sxhkd.</a> you can use this as your hotkey manager, instead of writing it in dwm's config and recompiling the program everytime. here is <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1043271659882291311/1119681513873756200/sxhkdrc">my config for sxhkd</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/2200g/newlook">newlook.</a> this is basically his newlook.sh - you might want to change the xrdb thingy.</li>
<li><a href="https://aadi.net.in/walls/">wallpapers.</a> you can download my wallpaper collection here &lt;3</li>
</ul>
<p>and uh yes ok bye for now.</p>
