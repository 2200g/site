	the blissful art of note-making <hr>

<p>note making.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h1 id="note-making">note-making</h1>
<p>making notes is a really important thing, as it allows a person to look back into a certain topic and recollect stuff.</p>
<p>basically jotting down whatever the teacher is saying is not note-making- thats like stenography or whatever the term is for the ppl who sit by the court and transcribe stuff like irl subtitles.</p>
<p>anyways yes so while making notes you need to write down your understanding of the concept- not just the book definitions. only this way, you will be able to recall things easily while revising thru your notes.</p>
<p>you can download n numbers of notes of a certain chapter/topic online, but they will never be as good as your own notes, if you put effort into them, instead of just making them for the sake of it.</p>
<h2 id="lecture-notes-and-fair-copies">lecture notes and fair copies</h2>
<p>i have a friend in the coaching i recently joined, who brings a single copy for the three subjects, writes whatever is being done in class, and then goes home and write stuff in a &quot;fair copy&quot;. </p>
<p>tbh, this is a good thing to do, you get to revise whatever had been done in class, while also making a copy that will be used in the future, when you are revising concepts. but, i dont think that it is good for all subjects, as it will take away a lot of time from your day, for things you will be able to remember by just looking at a sum once (im talking about maths). </p>
<p>it is advisable for chemistry tho- cuz chemistry.</p>
<h2 id="indentation">indentation</h2>
<p>oh i love indentation, i always use indentation wherever i can. just the thought of having an hierarchical order in which the notes are organised makes me go :))))</p>
<p>anyways yes indentaion is really useful in a lot of cases, such as making sub-definitions or like writing examples. this way your information will not just go anywhere it wants to but will be in a neat and clean order.</p>
<h2 id="spacing">spacing</h2>
<p>this is just personal preference, but i like spaced out notes- it makes it easier to read, and yeah looking at chunks of information compacted into like 4 lines is not uh dandy (look at me using cool words). </p>
<h2 id="colors">colors</h2>
<p>meh, i dont really find colorful notes attractive, but once again this is just personal preference. 
i usually just stick to 3 colors,
- blue,
- black,
- red.</p>
<h2 id="copies">copies</h2>
<p>it is important to create an index and update it everytime u start writing ab a new topic, this way your copy is going to be organised by itself.
you can also stick those sticky label thingies and label the copy asper chapters.</p>
<p>it is also important to store your copies properly, wo them getting dirty- no eating maggi and spilling everything on ur copy.</p>
<h2 id="abbreviations">abbreviations</h2>
<p>unless youre a god at english (like me), refrain from using abbreviations, but if you dont care ab your english-skills go ahead.</p>
<hr />
<p>anyways thats pretty much it byebye &lt;3</p>
